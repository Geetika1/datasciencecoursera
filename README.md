The script first stores the information from different files (train and test) into different variables
It then assigns the column names from features file and merges the data
Only the data for mean and standard deviation columns is then collected
I then assign the activities with their names (1 for walking and so on)
The participants columns are then assigned the names
The average is calculated and stored in tidy_data.txt file
